# Greetings 🗿

Thank you for taking the time to learn more about me. I'll try not to waste your time and attention.

**I'm pretty awesome.** I'm working on a more comprehensive website to better substantiate that claim. For now, this is my minimal-viable-product.
 
# The short story 🥞

* I'm *really good* at problem solving.
* I'm *really good* at idea generation.
* I'm an *above average* software engineer. At age 7, I started to teach myself software development, and never really stopped.
* I'm looking for a new income adventure. (let's collaborate)
* I'm an *amateur* artist.

# Awesomeness Credentials 🦚

Here are some things I've done that I would like to brag about.

More details coming, but some elevator headlines:

* As a 30th birthday present for my wife, I organized a flash-mob of 100+ to secretly meet her in Disney World to serenade her. I did this in a matter of days while miles away in the state of Delaware.
* I once wrote a Windows app that was downloaded thousands of times, cloned 5 times by other developers, inspired a web app, and won me an award from the users.
* I once collaborated with Lawrence Lessig and George Takei in a project which cost Steve Wozniak a few million dollars (which he was happy to spend)<sup>1</sup>.
* I helped publish a [Simpsons themed Doom 2 mod](http://waltersgameboy.tripod.com/simpdoom/) which has been downloaded over 100K times, featured in several youtube videos, and runner up to appear in an episode of an [Netflix series](https://www.netflix.com/title/81019087) <sup>2</sup>. 
* Won a Halloween contest at [instructables.com](https://www.instructables.com/Singing-PumpkinsParallel-Port-Relay-Box/) . *Don't build my thing, it was a fun concept, with a terribly dangerous design*
* I was offered money by TruTV for permission to use one of my [silly videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTu0YEVSXl8) on one of their shows. I declined their offer after investigating the show and deciding that I did not wish to be a part of something that I considered to be low-effort and mean-spirited.

<sub>1 I don't have all the details of how instrumental my work was, but from my understanding of the facts, it was significant.</sub>

<sub>2 Netflix claim is outrageous spurious conjecture</sub>

# Nice things people have said about me 🦖

>What are you doing in this class if you know how to develop software like that?

*Classmate* in college object oriented programming class after he learned that I developed a Windows app that he used.

> Now there is a man who solves problems.

*Brother-in-law Scott*  After I improvised a trampoline spring removal tool in less than a minute based on a verbal description of the missing tool. 

>I've never seen someone who just goes out and solves problems like that.

*Former manager* After I set up a box fan in our office to vent some noxious fumes coming from a renovation project in the office next door.

> You're just like McGuyver

*Brother-in-law Micheal:*  I forget the context, but it was probably after I did something amazing.
